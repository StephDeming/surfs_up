# Surf's Up Analysis

## Overview: 
In order to secure funding for a business proposal (an ice-cream and surf shop on the island of Oahu, Hawaii)temperature data for the months of June and December needed to be analyzed in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results:
- The average recorded temperature in June on Oahu is (rounded by .1) 75 degrees. The average temperature for December is 71 degrees; a difference of four degrees. 
- The minimun amd maximum temperatures (64/85 in June and 56/83 in December) show a temperate climate with a large winter weather dip. 
- The standard deviation for both months is low. Which infers that that overall between the two months there arent significant temperature fluctuations.

## Summary: 
Other than the low of 59 in December the temperature seems to remain high for both months. And great for eating ice cream. 

There isn't enough data to ascertain whether or not this business model would be sustainable with these two queries alone. Without water/wave conditions, the location on the island where the shop would be located(the weather patterns on the windward and leeward sides of the island are different) and precipitation levels the analysis seems shallow.
